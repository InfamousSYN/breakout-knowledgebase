!!! tip "Fast Search"
    Use the search bar at the top or press **/** to quickly find shortcuts (e.g., `CTRL+O`) or specific applications (e.g., `Edge`).

Welcome to the central repository for VDI and restricted environment breakout techniques. This site is designed for quick reference during penetration testing engagements.

Remember breakout techniques are fairly common and trivial to find. Our advice should not to have clients stomp specific shortcuts or applications, rather demonstrate the ability to breakout as a means to justify strategic controls:

1. Application Control
2. Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
3. Network Segmentation

If the threat actor can't use applications on the VDA other than published applications to lateral movement then that can reduce the blast radius of a breakout.
